# U/I assistant proxy

A Cloudflare Worker that stands between the [`hosted/`](../hosted) build of
U/I and Anthropic's API. It holds your real Anthropic API key as a
server-side secret — the browser never sees it — and enforces a spending
cap before forwarding any request, gated by a passcode you hand out.

This exists because a plain static site (like the root `index.html`, which
is genuinely BYOK — each visitor supplies and pays for their own key) has
nowhere to hide a shared key: anything in that HTML/JS is visible to
anyone who opens dev tools. If you want people to use *your* key instead of
their own, that key has to live behind a server you control, with limits
you control. That's this Worker.

## What it does and doesn't protect against

- **Does**: keep your Anthropic key out of client-side code; require a
  passcode per person; cap spend per passcode per day and in total per
  month, checked *before* the expensive call is made so a burst of
  requests can't all sneak in under the cap at once; restrict which
  models and how many output tokens a request can ask for.
- **Doesn't**: defend against a truly adversarial user who has a valid
  passcode and is deliberately trying to race the cap — Workers KV
  (used for the spend counters) is only eventually consistent. For an
  invite-only personal tool that's an accepted tradeoff. If you ever need
  stronger guarantees, replace the `USAGE` KV reads/writes in
  `src/index.js` with a Durable Object, which can serialize them.

## Setup — dashboard only, no command line needed

Everything below is done by clicking through Cloudflare's website at
[dash.cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com). A free account is
enough. This is the path that was actually used to set this up — not
`wrangler` — so it doesn't assume Node, npm, or any installed tools.

1. **Create the Worker.**
   - Dashboard → **Workers & Pages** → **Create** → **Workers** → give it
     a name (e.g. `ui-assistant` — this becomes part of its URL) →
     deploy the placeholder it starts you with.
   - Open the new Worker → **Edit code**. Select all of the placeholder
     code and delete it, then paste in the entire contents of
     [`src/index.js`](src/index.js) from this folder. Click **Deploy**.
   - Whenever you update the code later, always replace the *whole* file
     this way (select all, delete, paste the new whole file) rather than
     editing just part of it in the dashboard editor — a partial edit in
     that editor is easy to get subtly wrong.

2. **Create two KV namespaces.**
   - Dashboard → **Storage & Databases** → **KV** → **Create a
     namespace**. Create one for usage tracking and one for passcodes —
     name them anything unique to your account, e.g. `ui-usage` and
     `ui-passcodes`. This namespace name is just a label in your
     account; it doesn't need to match anything in the code.

3. **Bind the namespaces to the Worker.**
   - Worker → **Settings** → **Bindings** → **Add binding** → **KV
     Namespace**.
   - Add one binding with **Variable name** typed exactly `USAGE`,
     pointing at your usage namespace.
   - Add a second with **Variable name** typed exactly `PASSCODES`,
     pointing at your passcodes namespace.
   - These two names are hardcoded in `src/index.js` and must match
     exactly, including case, or the Worker can't find them.

4. **Add the plain-text settings.**
   - Same **Settings** page → **Variables and Secrets** → add three
     plain-text variables:
     - `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` — the exact origin `hosted/index.html` is served
       from, no trailing slash (e.g. `https://yourname.github.io`).
       Requests from any other origin are rejected before the passcode
       is even checked.
     - `PER_USER_DAILY_CAP_CENTS` — cents per person per day (e.g. `500`
       = $5.00).
     - `GLOBAL_MONTHLY_CAP_CENTS` — cents total per month (e.g. `2000` =
       $20.00).

5. **Add your real Anthropic key as a secret.**
   - Same page → **Variables and Secrets** → add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
     but set its type to **Secret** (encrypted), not plain text. Paste
     your real key from `console.anthropic.com`. Never put the real key
     anywhere in this repo.

6. **Redeploy after saving Settings.** This is a real Cloudflare quirk,
   confirmed repeatedly while setting these up: variables, bindings, and
   secrets sometimes don't actually take effect until the Worker's code
   is redeployed, even though the dashboard shows them as saved. After
   adding everything above, go back to **Edit code** and click **Deploy**
   again — no code change needed — to force it to pick everything up. If
   something that looks correctly configured still doesn't work, this is
   the first thing to try.

7. **Check the pricing table.** `PRICING` at the top of `src/index.js`
   has already been verified against Anthropic's published per-model
   rates. If you add a model that isn't in that table, or Anthropic
   changes its pricing, update the numbers there — the spending caps are
   only as accurate as this table.

8. **Copy the Worker's URL.** It's shown at the top of the Worker's
   overview page: `https://ui-assistant.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`.
   Paste that into `ASSISTANT_PROXY_URL` near the top of the `<script>`
   block in `hosted/index.html`.

9. **Create a passcode for yourself (and anyone you invite).** No
   installs needed — this is done entirely in your browser:
   - Open any webpage, open DevTools (F12) → **Console** tab, and run:
     ```js
     async function hashPasscode(p) {
       const buf = await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', new TextEncoder().encode(p));
       return [...new Uint8Array(buf)].map(b => b.toString(16).padStart(2, '0')).join('');
     }
     await hashPasscode('choose-a-long-random-passcode-here');
     ```
   - This prints a long hex string — that's the hash. **Write the
     passcode itself down somewhere safe before you close this tab.**
     Once it's hashed there's no way to recover the original from the
     hash, and you'll need the raw passcode again if you ever want to
     re-share or double-check it.
   - Dashboard → **Storage & Databases** → **KV** → your `PASSCODES`
     namespace → **Add entry**.
     - **Key**: `passcode:` followed by the hash, all lowercase, exactly
       like that — e.g. `passcode:3a7f...`.
     - **Value**: `{"name":"your-name","active":true}`
   - Hand the *passcode* (not the hash) to whoever it's for, out of band
     — not in plaintext over email/Slack if you want to be careful; a
     password manager's sharing feature works well.
   - To revoke someone later, edit that same KV entry's value to
     `{"name":"...","active":false}` instead of deleting it — this keeps
     their usage history intact.

## If something looks broken but the settings look right

Test in an Incognito/Private browser window before assuming a config
value is wrong. Service Workers and cached local storage can make a
*browser* look broken (stale passcode, stale proxy URL) even when the
server side is fine — a private window starts with none of that cached
state, so it isolates whether the problem is client-side or server-side.

## If you have Node and `wrangler` installed

None of the above requires it, but everything can also be done from the
command line with [`wrangler`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/)
— `wrangler kv namespace create`, `wrangler secret put`,
`wrangler deploy`, and so on. `wrangler.toml` in this folder documents
the same settings for that path, and `scripts/add-passcode.mjs` will
print the exact `wrangler kv key put` command for step 9 above. Use
whichever path you have the tools for — they produce the same result.

## Cost note

The Worker's own Cloudflare usage (requests, KV reads/writes) stays
comfortably inside Cloudflare's free tier for a small invite-only group.
The only real cost is what you already expect: Anthropic API usage, now
bounded by the caps above instead of open-ended.
